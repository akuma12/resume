					<h3>What I Will Do</h3>
                                        <p>
                                                I want to work in a fast-paced environment that challenges me to bring my best to the job every day. I will
                                                continue to test the edges of the web and strive to maintain the highest levels of skill. I will bring a
                                                customer-oriented approach to design, including cross-platform browser testing and extensive usability testing.
                                                I will bring a positive, fun attitude and an unwavering commitment to my job.
                                        </p>

					<h3>What I Do</h3>
					<p>
						Though I wear many hats in my current position at Wright State University, my primary purpose
						is to develop web and application solutions to common problems faced by the Computing and Telecommunications
						Services department, as well as other departments within the university. From simple email forms, to complete
						survey solutions, I have used my knowledge and creativity to improve the services that the university offers it's
						faculty, staff and students. I strive to always stay ahead on the latest technologies, and challenge myself and
						those around me to stay on the bleeding edge of web design and development.

					<h3>What I Have Done</h3>
                                        <p>
                                                <div class="header">Planned and instituted the university laptop rental program, Laptops2Go.</div>
                                                <p class="tabbed">This program allows students to check out a laptop free of charge for up to four hours.
                                                I developed a robust checkout management system which allows students to check out a laptop in just a few minutes.
                                                Administrative features allow staff to track checked-out laptops and maintain users. Recently redesigned the system,
                                                utilizing Kohana PHP, jQuery and MySQL to make a fully interactive, real-time web application to better track our
                                                assets and improve service time and reliability.</p>
                                                <div class="header">Converted the paper customer service survey into an interactive web-based system.</div>
                                                <p class="tabbed">Created dynamic reports for the customer satisfaction survey using jQuery and Kohana PHP.<br />
                                                This project is when I first began using a PHP framework, Kohana. This allowed me to utilize an MVC framework
                                                to force myself into object-oriented PHP and greatly reduce the amount of time I spent on the project.
                                                I appreciated the way that jQueryUI helped to make a beautiful, easy to use interface
                                                with little effort on my part.</p>
                                                <div class="header">Developed a mass password resetting tool to reduce Help Desk workload.</div>
                                                <p class="tabbed">I created this tool in response to our Guest Account program. Resetting large
                                                numbers of passwords was becoming too time consuming, so I utilized my skills in PHP to create
                                                a program that interfaced with our LDAP servers and reset multiple accounts simultaneously.</p>
                                                <div class="header">Utilized open source packages to provide quick, quality-added solutions for clients.</div>
                                                <p class="tabbed">I have put together quite a few WordPress web sites for clients in need of blogs and
                                                Content Management Systems. I have also used open source plug-ins and packages to improve homegrown systems.</p>
                                                <div class="header">Built and administered multiple web servers, running Windows Server 2003 and Ubuntu Linux.</div>
                                                <p class="tabbed">Because I maintain many web applications, I am also responsible for the maintenance and
                                                administration of my own servers. I have built four Windows Server 2003 IIS servers and an Ubuntu LAMP server.
                                                I feel very comfortable in either environment. I enjoy Linux for it's reliability and server-oriented architecture.
                                                Windows also has a high level of support and a greater user-base.</p>
                                        </p>
